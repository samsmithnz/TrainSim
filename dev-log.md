- Day 0 - Prep: Started by creating a new GitHub repo, Unity project, and importing a few packages, POLYGON Icons pack, POLYGON Prototype pack, and most importantly, Simple Trains.
- Day 1 - The grid. I wanted to setup the level with a grid. I accomplished this fairly quickly, and then moved to the next step, adding static tracks and a train. ![image](https://github.com/samsmithnz/TrainSim/assets/8389039/c6f07327-dfe9-465a-a7e0-c2eb079ebcf1)
- Day 2 - working on a few different pieces. Plugged in a basic camera, and then rearranged the scale + the tracks to fit. Next, we need the track to work on the tracks! ![image](https://github.com/samsmithnz/TrainSim/assets/8389039/5130b52b-3dc0-452a-a20f-1c8d08d7a826)
